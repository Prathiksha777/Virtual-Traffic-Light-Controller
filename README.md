# 🚦 Virtual Traffic Light Controller

An intelligent, flexible, and fully simulated **Virtual Traffic Light Control System** designed for traffic flow optimization and smart city integration. This project models real-world traffic intersection management using programmable logic, dynamic timing control, and vehicle and pedestrian priority handling.

## 🚦 How It Works

The system simulates a four-way intersection with two main roads:
- **EW**: East-West direction
- **SN**: South-North direction

The traffic light controller:
- Cycles through green, yellow, and red signals for each direction.
- Handles pedestrian crossing requests with a cooldown period to prevent repeated triggers.
- Prioritizes emergency vehicle requests, seamlessly integrating with pedestrian and vehicle flow.
